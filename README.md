# My Node.js Application

This is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes (or Minikube). This project includes automated testing, Docker image building, Docker Hub deployment, and Kubernetes deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) (for local Kubernetes deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhinavVihan/Better.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository-name
Install the required dependencies:


npm install
Running Locally
To run the application locally in development mode:

Start the application with the following command:


npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Running with Docker
To build the Docker image and run it in a container:

Build the Docker image:


docker build -t my-app .
Run the Docker container:


docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Running on Kubernetes (Minikube)
If you're using Minikube to run a local Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to deploy the app:

Start Minikube:

minikube start
Deploy to Kubernetes:


kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
Expose the service and get the URL:

minikube service my-app-service
This will open the application in your default web browser at the Minikube IP address.

CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the following tasks:

Run tests on each push or pull request to the release branch.
Build the Docker image from the Node.js application and push it to Docker Hub.
Deploy the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster (using Minikube in this case).
Workflow Overview
Build Job: Installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the Docker image.
Deploy Job: Logs in to Docker Hub and pushes the image to the repository.
Kubernetes Deploy Job: Deploys the image to the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.
Notifications: Sends email notifications based on the deployment success or failure.

Troubleshooting
Docker Image Build Issues: If you encounter any issues building the Docker image, make sure your Dockerfile is properly configured.
Kubernetes Deployment: Ensure that your Kubernetes setup (Minikube or other) is correctly configured, and kubectl is able to communicate with your cluster.
Minikube Issues: If you encounter problems with Minikube, you can reset it by running minikube stop and minikube start.
